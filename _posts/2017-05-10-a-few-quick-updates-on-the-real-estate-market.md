The spring market is off to a great start. We have low inventory right now to go along with low interest rates and strong demand. This puts us in a strong seller’s market.&nbsp;

Properties that are both priced well and show well are getting multiple offers in most neighborhoods. Even properties that don’t show well, like fixer-uppers, are doing very well if they are priced correctly.&nbsp;

We have had success helping buyers and sellers in this market with a few different methods. One of these is by matching them with off-market properties. These are homes that aren’t technically for sale but can be sold for the right price. A lot of times, we are getting our sellers those bottom-line prices that they set beforehand.

If you are thinking of selling your home now, this summer, or anytime at all this year, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you out.

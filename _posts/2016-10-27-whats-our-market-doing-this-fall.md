The 2016 market has seen quite a bit of change lately.

In the spring, we started out red-hot with multiple offers on almost every property due to low inventory. We then saw a cool down during the summer, which confused a lot of sellers. **Now in the fall, we’re seeing a stabilization**.

Some neighborhoods in some areas are still very hot for certain product types. Overall, though, we’re seeing low inventory in our area. The biggest change happening and the biggest concern for sellers is the fact that we’re seeing an increase in days on market. We’re seeing price reductions and price changes as well.

This means that, depending on whether you'd like to move up and where you're moving, **now may be a great time to sell**.

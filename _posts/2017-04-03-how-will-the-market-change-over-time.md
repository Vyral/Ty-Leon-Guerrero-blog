As you can imagine, our market is moving really fast. We’ve been experiencing a really strong seller’s market since February.&nbsp;

**Most home sellers out there have benefitted from the fact that there really aren’t a lot of homes for buyers to choose from**. If a property shows well and is priced properly, in most neighborhoods, it will receive multiple offers. There is a good chance it may even start a bidding war.

I expect us to see these conditions continue through April and into May. However, I would caution you that if you’re thinking about selling to do it sooner rather than later. Interest rates have increased since the election, but they are still low historically speaking for the time being. Homes are very affordable right now and it could be the perfect time for you to lock in a low rate.

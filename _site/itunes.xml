        <description>

The 2016 market has seen quite a bit of change lately. 

In the spring, we started out red-hot with multiple offers on almost every property due to low inventory. We then saw a cooldown during the summer, which confused a lot of sellers. Now in the fall, we’re seeing a stabilization. 

Some neighborhoods in some areas are still very hot for certain product types. Overall, though, we’re seeing low inventory in our area. The biggest change happening and the biggest concern for sellers is the fact that we’re seeing an increase in days on market. We’re also seeing price reductions and price changes as well. 

“We’re seeing low inventory and an increase in days on market.”

This means that, depending on what your move up is or where you’re going, now may be a great time to sell. 

If you have any questions or have a video topic in mind you’d like us to discuss, please feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!
